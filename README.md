# Boris Bikes

We have been asked for a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use.
We have built a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on).

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/AlexandraGF/boris-bikes.git`

`command_to_install_dependencies` (e.g. `bundle`)

## Usage

`command_to_start` (e.g. `rackup` or `rails s`)
Navigate to `http://localhost:4567/`


## Running tests

`test_command` (e.g. `rspec`)
